# Phrase Hunter: Fallout New Vegas Edition


## Installation 

Simply launch the index.HTML file in the program files to begin playing the game in your browser of choice.

### How to Play

Phrase Hunter: FNV Edition is a guessing game in which a random phrase is generated and the player must guess all of the letters within the phrase. Each round allows the player to guess up to four wrong letters and still be able to win. After the fifth wrong guess, the round ends in a loss. Each letter, whether guessed correctly or incorrectly is disabled and color coded to prevent additional accidental guesses. The game can be played indefinitely and the phrases, misses, and on screen keyboard is refreshed at the beginning of each round. 

### Customization

Users can add / remove their own phrases by opening the Game.js file and referring to lines 13-17 like so:

```
      new Phrase("The game was rigged from the start"),
      new Phrase("Ave true to Caesar"),
      new Phrase("I told them I had a theoretical degree in physics"),
      new Phrase("Begin again and let go"),
      new Phrase("This is Mister New Vegas"),
```

The text in between the quotation marks can be changed at the user's leisure
